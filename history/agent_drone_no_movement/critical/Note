Description: MAP controller, bad initial conditions, biased motion, large radio latency, strong noise

scenario: drone can not move

control mode: MAP

initial conditions: 
	* p0 in [0,30] uniform
	* c0 in [0.0,0.0] (fixed), h=10
	* p(p0) in [-50.0,-30.0] gaussian std.dev. 100

agent motion: random walk (0.0,0.0)

RSSI propagation:
	* no uncertainty
	* sigma = 3.5
	* T_RF = 10

PF:
	* Ns = 300
	* process model std. dev. = 5

others: 
	* sim duration = 100
	* E_tot = 100
	* K = [1*1.0E-1, 5*1.0E-4,5*1.0E-4, 1*1.0E-0]
	* f = 100
	* t_clock = 1/200
